abstract = {A number of friction and wear phenomena are explicable in terms of the surface energy of adhesion of the contacting materials. In the friction field, it is found qualitatively that high friction coefficients are found for sliding materials with high surface energy/hardness ratios and conversely. Unfortunately, it is not easy to test this relationship quantitatively because the derived expression contains parameters which cannot be independently controlled. However, in the wear field, it has been found possible to derive an expression for the size of loose wear particles which can be readily tested; namely, that the average size of loose wear particles is proportional to the surface energy/hardness ratio, the nondimensional constant of proportionality being 60 000. Experiments with 15 different materials show the validity of this expression. Another phenomenon, adhesion, which also seems to be governed by surface energy considerations, is discussed in qualitative terms.},

abstract = {This study compares two methods for estimating static friction coefficients for skin. In the first method, referred to as the 'tilt method', a hand supporting a flat object is tilted until the object slides. The friction coefficient is estimated as the tangent of the angle of the object at the slip. The second method estimates the friction coefficient as the pull force required to begin moving a flat object over the surface of the hand, divided by object weight. Both methods were used to estimate friction coefficients for 12 subjects and three materials (cardboard, aluminium, rubber) against a flat hand and against fingertips. No differences in static friction coefficients were found between the two methods, except for that of rubber, where friction coefficient was 11{\%} greater for the tilt method. As with previous studies, the friction coefficients varied with contact force and contact area. Static friction coefficient data are needed for analysis and design of objects that are grasped or manipulated with the hand. The tilt method described in this study can easily be used by ergonomic practitioners to estimate static friction coefficients in the field in a timely manner.},

abstract = {Scale effects in dry friction at macro- to nanoscale are considered. According to the adhesional model of friction, the friction force depends on the real area of contact and the average shear strength of asperity contacts during sliding. The scale dependence of the so-called geometrically necessary dislocations causes enhanced hardness with decreasing scale. In the case of plastic contacts, enhanced hardness results in a decrease in the real area of contact. The average shear strength at the interface is associated with dislocation-assisted sliding (microslip) and increases with decreasing scale, from geometrical considerations. In cases of single-asperity and multi-asperity elastic or plastic contact, the scale dependence of the real area of contact and shear strength results in scale-dependent friction. Comparisons of the model with experimental data are also presented. {\textcopyright} 2003 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

His work on friction originated in studies of the rotational resistance of axles and the mechanics of screw threads. He pursued the topic for more than 20 years, incorporating his empirical knowledge of friction into models for several mechanical systems. Diagrams which have been assumed to represent his experimental apparatus are misleading, but his work was undoubtedly based on experimental measurements and probably largely involved lubricated contacts. Although his work had no influence on the development of the subject over the succeeding centuries, Leonardo da Vinci holds a unique position as a pioneer in tribology.},

abstract = {Forces acting within the area of atomic contact between surfaces play a central role in friction and adhesion. Such forces are traditionally calculated using continuum contact mechanics, which is known to break down as the contact radius approaches atomic dimensions. Yet contact mechanics is being applied at ever smaller lengths, driven by interest in shrinking devices to nanometre scales, creating nanostructured materials with optimized mechanical properties, and understanding the molecular origins of macroscopic friction and adhesion. Here we use molecular simulations to test the limits of contact mechanics under ideal conditions. Our findings indicate that atomic discreteness within the bulk of the solids does not have a significant effect, but that the atomic-scale surface roughness that is always produced by discrete atoms leads to dramatic deviations from continuum theory. Contact areas and stresses may be changed by a factor of two, whereas friction and lateral contact stiffness change by an order of magnitude. These variations are likely to affect continuum predictions for many macroscopic rough surfaces, where studies show that the total contact area is broken up into many separate regions with very small mean radius},

abstract = {Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are in many respects very similar to real experiments. In MD, first, sample is prepared, a model system consisting of N particles is selected, and then Newton's equations of motion are solved for the system until the properties of the system no longer change with time. To measure an observable quantity in a MD simulation, one must first of all be able to express this observable as a function of the positions and momenta of the particles in the system. The best introduction to MD simulations is to consider a simple program. To start the simulation, one should assign initial positions and velocities to all particles in the system. The particle positions should be chosen compatible with the structure that one is aiming to simulate. A good MD program requires a good algorithm to integrate Newton's equations of motion. Accuracy for large time steps is more important because the longer the time step that one can use, the fewer evaluations of the forces are needed per unit of simulation time. For most MD applications, Verlet-like algorithms are perfectly adequate. However, sometimes it is convenient to employ a higher-order algorithm.},

abstract = {Metal matrix composites (MMCs) are an important class of engineering materials that are increasingly replacing a number of conventional materials in the automotive, aerospace, marine, and sports industries due to their lightweight and superior mechanical properties. In MMCs, nonmetallic materials are embedded into the metals or the alloys as reinforcements to obtain a novel material with attractive engineering properties, such as improved ultimate tensile strength, ductility, toughness, and tribological behavior. In this chapter, an attempt has been made to summarize the tribological performance of various MMCs as a function of several relevant parameters. These parameters include material parameters (size, shape, volume fraction, and type of the reinforcements), mechanical parameters (normal load and sliding speed), and physical parameters (temperature and the environment). In general, it was shown that the wear resistance and friction coefficient of MMCs are improved by increasing the volume fraction of the reinforcements. As the normal load and sliding speed increase, the wear rate of the composites increases and the friction coefficient of the composites decreases. The wear rate and friction coefficient decrease with increasing temperature up to a critical temperature, and thereafter both wear rate and friction coefficient increase with increasing temperature. The nano-composites showed best friction and wear performance when compared to micro-composites.},

The atomic scale roughness present on any tip made of discrete atoms is shown to have profound effects on the results. Contact areas, local stresses, and the work of adhesion change by factors of 2 to 4, and the friction and lateral stiffness vary by orders of magnitude.

@book{Introduction2Friction,
abstract = {Many complex systems respond to a continuous input of energy by an accumulation of stress over time, interrupted by sudden energy releases called avalanches. Recently, it has been pointed out that several basic features of avalanche dynamics are induced at the microscopic level by relaxation processes, which are neglected by most models. During my thesis, I studied two well-known models of avalanche dynamics, modified minimally by the inclusion of some forms of relaxation. The first system is that of a viscoelastic interface driven in a disordered medium. In mean-field, we prove that the interface has a periodic behaviour (with a new, emerging time scale), with avalanche events that span the whole system. We compute semi-analytically the friction force acting on this surface, and find that it is compatible with classical friction experiments. In finite dimensions (2D), the mean-field system-sized events become local, and numerical simulations give qualitative and quantitative results in good agreement with several important features of real earthquakes. The second system including a minimal form of relaxation consists in a toy model of avalanches: the Directed Percolation process. In our study of a non-Markovian variant of Directed Percolation, we observed that the universality class was modified but not completely. In particular, in the non-Markov case an exponent changes of value while several scaling relations still hold. This picture of an extended universality class obtained by the addition of a non-Markovian perturbation to the dynamics provides promising prospects for our first system.},
