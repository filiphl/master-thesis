@article{LeonardoDaVinciStudies,
abstract = {Based on a detailed study of Leonardo da Vinci's notebooks, this review examines the development of his understanding of the laws of friction and their application. His work on friction originated in studies of the rotational resistance of axles and the mechanics of screw threads. He pursued the topic for more than 20 years, incorporating his empirical knowledge of friction into models for several mechanical systems. Diagrams which have been assumed to represent his experimental apparatus are misleading, but his work was undoubtedly based on experimental measurements and probably largely involved lubricated contacts. Although his work had no influence on the development of the subject over the succeeding centuries, Leonardo da Vinci holds a unique position as a pioneer in tribology.},

@book{UnderstandingMolecularSimulation,
abstract = {Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are in many respects very similar to real experiments. In MD, first, sample is prepared, a model system consisting of N particles is selected, and then Newton's equations of motion are solved for the system until the properties of the system no longer change with time. To measure an observable quantity in a MD simulation, one must first of all be able to express this observable as a function of the positions and momenta of the particles in the system. The best introduction to MD simulations is to consider a simple program. To start the simulation, one should assign initial positions and velocities to all particles in the system. The particle positions should be chosen compatible with the structure that one is aiming to simulate. A good MD program requires a good algorithm to integrate Newton's equations of motion. Accuracy for large time steps is more important because the longer the time step that one can use, the fewer evaluations of the forces are needed per unit of simulation time. For most MD applications, Verlet-like algorithms are perfectly adequate. However, sometimes it is convenient to employ a higher-order algorithm.},

abstract = {The equation of motion of a system of 864 particles interacting through a Lennard-Jones potential has been integrated for various values of the temperature and density, relative, generally, to a fluid state. The equilibrium properties have been calculated and are shown to agree very well with the corresponding properties of argon. It is concluded that, to a good approximation, the equilibrium state of argon can be described through a two-body potential.},

@article{Robbins2005,
abstract = {Forces acting within the area of atomic contact between surfaces play a central role in friction and adhesion. Such forces are traditionally calculated using continuum contact mechanics, which is known to break down as the contact radius approaches atomic dimensions. Yet contact mechanics is being applied at ever smaller lengths, driven by interest in shrinking devices to nanometre scales, creating nanostructured materials with optimized mechanical properties, and understanding the molecular origins of macroscopic friction and adhesion. Here we use molecular simulations to test the limits of contact mechanics under ideal conditions. Our findings indicate that atomic discreteness within the bulk of the solids does not have a significant effect, but that the atomic-scale surface roughness that is always produced by discrete atoms leads to dramatic deviations from continuum theory. Contact areas and stresses may be changed by a factor of two, whereas friction and lateral contact stiffness change by an order of magnitude. These variations are likely to affect continuum predictions for many macroscopic rough surfaces, where studies show that the total contact area is broken up into many separate regions with very small mean radius},
